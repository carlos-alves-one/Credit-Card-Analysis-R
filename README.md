# Credit Card Default Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict credit card defaults using machine learning models. The objective is to identify credit card holders who are likely to default in the next month, based on historical data.

## Datasets
- **creditdefault_train.csv**: Contains 15,000 entries with 24 features, including demographic information, credit data, and historical payment records. Used for training the models.
- **creditdefault_test.csv**: Used for testing and evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. It follows the same structure as the training dataset.

## Methodology
The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, model training (including Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models), and evaluation. The Random Forest model was identified as the most effective.
